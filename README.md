Scripts to extract the old of login nodes, still early version

Have all the files in the same folder

Execute from eahc login node

```
./lload.sh &
```

We create one file per one minute

Execute:

``
prepare_stats.sh i
```

where i is the id of the login node. You need to change the 3rd line of the file prepare_stats.sh in case your login node is not called login1 etc...
